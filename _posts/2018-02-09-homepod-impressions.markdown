I bought a HomePod. Here are my impressions.

<!--more-->

## 1. It's expensive.

$500 is a lot of dollarydoos for what this thing is. And what it is, is an
OK sounding music player. Think of it like a modern version of a 1980s
boombox, but with a lot less functionality.

## 2. The sound is pretty good.

Though for the money it ought to be. I'd say, for the money, the sound is not
good *enough*. Audiophiles beware. You're supposed to trust the algorithms to
make things sound good. You won't like giving up this much control, and you 
certainly won't like the sound quality that comes out of it when you only have
a single unit.

Much better AV equipment can be had for the same money, if sound quality is
all you're after, you are still better off doing it yourself.

It does "fill the room" with sound, as promised. But if you wanted your room
to sound exactly like a concert hall, or to be able to pick out individual
instruments in a rock concert recording, you'll probably be disappointed.

## 3. Siri is still a derp.

Maybe she still struggles with the Australian accent, but I've found it the
same level of hit-and-miss that you'll get on your iPhone. If you have trouble
getting Siri to recognise phrases on your iPhone, HomePod will also give you
grief. This is a pretty bad thing since voice is the primary interaction
mechanism.

The American voices are still significantly better than the Australian
ones. I suggest changing it.

It does try very hard to cancel "hey siri" activation on your other Apple
devices if the HomePod hears you, but it doesn't always work. If your HomePod
doesn't hear you, your phone will still activate, and if it's not nearby it can
be awkward to retry.

## 4. Music over voice is clunky.

Sometimes I don't remember the song name or album name I want to listen to.
Voice doesn't give me a convenient way to glance through my library, so I have
to cross reference my computer anyway.

Often, I have to be way more specific than I should have to be, for example,
if I say "play brand new eyes", it won't pick up that I meant the Paramore
album, unless I say "play brand new eyes by paramore" â€” even though there's
exactly one album in my library by that name.

If I want to know the name of the song, I can say "hey siri what song is this",
but that interrupts the song by ducking the volume while she responds.

I haven't worked out yet if there's some way to queue up multiple albums to
play in order, but "play albums by paramore" only played a single album.

On the other hand, when I said "hey siri, add this album to my library", she
did just that, and immediately my iTunes window showed the album in Recently
Added; that is fucking magical.

## 5. As an assistant it's a failure.

"I wish I could, but I can't access your calendars here."

## 6. What problem is this solving anyway?

The technology in this thing is very impressive. The setup was seamless, its
integration with Apple Music is slick. I'm just struggling with what
problem it's trying to solve? Apple does best when identifying real problems
people have and then creating a product that solves it with perfect execution.

The technology and the execution here is very good, but what was that problem
in the first place? Are there really that many people around with that problem?
I worry it's not going to find an audience.

I see this thing basically like a $500 bluetooth speaker. I think $500 for
a bluetooth speaker (which doesn't even support bluetooth!!) is pathological
insanity, but here I am.
