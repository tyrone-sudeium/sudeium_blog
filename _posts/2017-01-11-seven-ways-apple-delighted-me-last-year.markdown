I honestly feel sad for Apple, because I had an awful lot of trouble coming up
with this list. My aim's simple: write a corollary to last week's post by coming
up with seven ways that Apple delighted me last year. This was a much harder
post to write, and not just because I'm a sad cynical bastard. There just wasn't
much to celebrate in Apple-land in 2016.
