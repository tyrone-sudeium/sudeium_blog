## About Me

I'm Tyrone, I've been doing iOS development professionally since 2008, and work
as the Engineering Lead for iOS at a leading online wagering business based in 
Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

In my spare time I like to play with:

* Ruby / mruby / Crystal
* Native Android
* React Native

I'm also working on an application to help emergency services personnel manage
their volunteers: [MemberHub](https://www.memberhub.com.au).
