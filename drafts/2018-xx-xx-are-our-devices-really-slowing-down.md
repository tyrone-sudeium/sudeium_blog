The widespread media hysteria about Apple's performance tuning on devices with
degraded batteries has brought into the public attention the issue of devices
seemingly becoming slower as they age. Is it purely cynical "planned
obsolence", or is it just the media kicking up a frenzy over nothing? The
correct answer is as always, long, boring, technical, and lying somewhere in
the middle. I'm going to attempt to explain that.

This is going to be a really long post, folks, so I recommend grabbing a cuppa,
and strapping in for the long haul.
