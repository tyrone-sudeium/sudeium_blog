Ever since their unexpected and meteoric rise back to the forefront of the
public consciousness, it has been *fashionable* to knock Apple. The problem has
only grown worse in the modern post-media information age, where clicks has
value, and the truth does not. So let me start this by exposing my agenda and
biases.

* I am a professional iOS developer by trade. It is in my financial best
interests for the Apple, iOS, and even the entire mobile app ecosystems as a 
whole to be healthy.
* I make nothing from this website. It only costs me money. It exists as a way
for me to vent frustration first and foremost, if people find it useful for
entertainment, professional or even recruitment purposes, cool.
* I'm professionally incentivised to prefer Apple products over their
competitors. 
* I generally like Apple products a whole lot and will almost always consider an
Apple first-party product over a competitor or third-party one. I own multiple
iOS devices, a gaming PC running Windows 10 and a laptop running Arch Linux.
I've been a Windows user for more of my life than a Mac user.
* If iOS ever failed, and we ended up with an Android monoculture, I would
consider that a very sad outcome.
* I already personally lament Google Chrome's almost monoculture.
* I generally do not enjoy using web technology.

So without further ado, here's my contribution to the global dead-horse-beating
festival that is Apple criticism.

<!--more-->

# 1. Swift 3

* Minimal actually useful additions, just expensive grammar changes.
* No stable ABI.
* Language still not stable.


# 2. Xcode Still Sucks

* Swift refactor still broken.
* Swift Package Manager projects completely broken.
* Completely disconnected from reality: instead of adding or fixing things we
need, they just replace working stuff with non-working stuff.
* Push notifications still suck.
* In app purchases still suck.
* They're trying too hard.
* UIKit is still awful and unproductive.

# 3. AirPods

* Their fundamental assumption about things going wireless is flawed.
* They sold us a lie.
* It doesn't work well.
* It was delayed.
* It's really expensive.

# 4. Operating Systems

* No Vulkan, no OpenGL 4.5.
* Sierra is buggy. iOS 10 is buggy. Everything feels worse and slower.
* Mac now boots slower than Windows and Linux (Arch).
* Automount is broken, zero faith it'll *ever* get fixed.
* They should just kill it already. They clearly don't care any more. It's more
heartbreaking to see them treat the Mac this way than it would be if they gave
it a quick death and gave us a decent migration path to Windows or Linux.

# 5. Web Stuff

* JavaScriptCore.framework still sucks.
* Safari Extensions suck.
* 

# 6. 

# 7. The New MacBook Pro (yeah I know)
